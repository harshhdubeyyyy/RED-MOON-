# Integration: RED-MOON- × BLACK-MOON-OS-

How the two repositories fit together, who owns what, and which
combinations are verified to work. This file lives in RED-MOON- (the
language side); BLACK-MOON-OS- carries a mirror note (`INTEGRATION.md`
at its root) from the distro side.

## Current state (27 Oct 2026)

- RED-MOON- live `main`: `627904d` (post-1.1.0 work pushed 27 Oct 2026).
- BLACK-MOON-OS- live `main`: `8fa46c2` (INTEGRATION.md added 27 Oct 2026).
- The post-1.1.0 drift is CLOSED: live `main` now contains the Windows
  port, registry deploy configs, JalOS with `ai`/`audit` (1408 lines),
  and CHANGELOG "Unreleased" entries.
- Local git HEAD here (`4688857`, v0.3.0 era) is stale and is NOT the
  push path: RED-MOON- is published by `scripts/push_forge.py`, which
  builds Git trees from this working tree via the GitHub API. Do not
  treat local git history as the project's history.

## Ownership

| Component | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Jal Pari language, compiler, stdlib, registry, packages | RED-MOON- | Source of truth; versioned releases |
| `examples/os/jalos.fg` (JalOS source) | RED-MOON- | Suite-guarded: `tests/run_tests.py` pins its exact 254-line demo output |
| Distro profile, theme, AI/sec launchers, installer | BLACK-MOON-OS- | archiso profile under `distro/` |
| `jalos.fg` copies in BLACK-MOON-OS- (root + `distro/.../blackmoon/`) | BLACK-MOON-OS- vendors | Byte-identical copies of RED-MOON-'s file; see Sync |
| Kaggle notebook (`jalos-on-kaggle.ipynb`) | Neither (workspace) | Reference combined workflow; clones both repos |

## Interfaces (explicit, no silent dependencies)

1. **Source compatibility.** BLACK-MOON-OS- consumes RED-MOON-
   releases: any `jalos.fg` it ships must build with the released
   compiler. JalOS needs v1.1.0-level features (arrays of structs,
   `break`, string indexing); minimum compiler is RED-MOON- v1.1.0.
2. **Vendoring, not submodules.** BLACK-MOON-OS- carries copies of
   `jalos.fg`, not a git submodule: the API push scripts build plain
   trees and do not support gitlinks, so copies plus a check script
   are the mechanism that actually works here.
3. **Sync check.** `tools/check_jalos_sync.py` (this repo) verifies
   the combined workflow: all three `jalos.fg` copies byte-identical,
   the demo output matches BLACK-MOON-OS-'s `tests/expected_output.txt`,
   and the `ai`/`audit` commands print their expected markers.
   Run it before any release that touches either side.
4. **Distro install.** `blackmoon-install-jalpari` (BLACK-MOON-OS-)
   clones RED-MOON- into the installed system and runs its
   `scripts/install.sh`. The distro therefore depends on RED-MOON-'s
   install script staying runnable, not on any internal layout.
5. **Kaggle notebook.** Clones RED-MOON- (compiler) + BLACK-MOON-OS-
   (`jalos.fg`) and builds across repos. It is the standing proof
   that the two live mains work together (see Matrix).

## Compatibility matrix (verified, not claimed)

| RED-MOON- | BLACK-MOON-OS- | Verified | How |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1.1.0 (`d56a903`) | `6fab40f` | 27 Oct 2026 | Kaggle kernel v1: RUNNING → COMPLETE; log shows demo, `ai` (4 epochs), `audit` |
| working tree post-1.1.0 | `6fab40f` | 27 Oct 2026 | `jalos.fg` byte-identical across all 3 copies; demo output identical (254 lines) |
| `627904d` | `8fa46c2` | 27 Oct 2026 | Fresh public clones of both repos: full native suite PASS + sync check 9/9 |

## Known drift (open, not hidden)

- No code drift at present: both live mains contain the same JalOS.
- Verification gap (honest): the Kaggle-verified combination is the
  older refs (`d56a903` + `6fab40f`); the new refs are verified from
  fresh public clones locally, not yet by a Kaggle re-run (that needs
  the owner's token re-supplied, per the standing rule).
- BLACK-MOON-OS- live `main` is current.
- The distro ISO itself is still unbuilt/unbooted (needs an Arch
  builder); the theme, AI/sec launchers, and installer theme-copying
  are untested until first boot, same as the rest of the profile.

## Sync procedure (on any JalOS or compiler change)

1. Change `examples/os/jalos.fg` here (or the compiler) and run the
   full native suite (`python3 forge.py test`).
2. Copy `jalos.fg` to BLACK-MOON-OS- root and
   `distro/archiso/airootfs/usr/share/blackmoon/jalos.fg`; byte-compare.
3. Run `python3 tools/check_jalos_sync.py --blackmoon <dir>`.
4. Push RED-MOON- (`scripts/push_forge.py`) and BLACK-MOON-OS-
   (`scripts/push_jalos.py`) — **only on the owner's explicit word**;
   pushes are external publication and are never assumed.
5. Update the matrix above with the new refs and how they were verified.

## Next actions

1. Decide the next version number/release notes (no version bump
   decided yet) — the pushed tree is post-1.1.0 but unversioned.
2. Kaggle re-run against the new refs (needs the owner's token
   re-supplied) to close the verification gap in the matrix.
3. First ISO build + VM boot test (needs an Arch builder) — the
   standing blocker for every distro claim beyond "profile done".
4. (Done 27 Oct 2026) HTTP client proxy (CONNECT) support — was the
   named next language feature JalOS wanted; shipped in RED-MOON-,
   tested in `tests/test_proxy_connect.py` (6/6).
